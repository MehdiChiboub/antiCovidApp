# AntiCovid Application Using Flutter

In order to stop the spread of this pandemic, we decided to create a mobile app to help us store a list containing the identifiers of people who have been in contact with an active case and inform them afterwards.

## Goals
1. Working on the UI of the application using the Figma tool.
2. Working on scanning the QR Code of the PCR test and adding it to the database.
3. Working on the internationalization of the application by adding two languages (French, English).
4. Working on NearbyConnection functionality to notify the users who had contact with an active case.


## Specification
>At first step we worked on the Communication with other instances of applications via Bluetooth. In this Part we used Google's Near-by Connection service and stored them in a database of local data. The list of contacts will be sent to the API in case the person is tested positive.

>In the second step we worked on The management of PCR tests and health passes by scanning the Qr-Code and viewing them afterwards, also we saved the data in a local database using Object-Box.

>Our app has another use case being the Display of statistics related to COVID pandemic such as coverage vaccine, the numbers of COVID cases, recovered people and death cases.

>Also we managed the translation of the application so it can be able to translate according to the systemâ€™s language.
